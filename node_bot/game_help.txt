To play a card you can either tap the button on the keyboard
or send a message using this syntax: "card_played played_as"
card_played indicates the card you want to play written with emoji or
by using number + suit initial (/suits) (i.e. 1D, 5C, 9H, 7S)
played_as is the number you want to play the card as (1, 5, 8, ...)
Obviously you must have the card you want to play in your hand (/hand)

If you tap a card on the keyboard it acts as following:
if there are no cards on the table it will play the selected card with its number (1D will be played as a 1, 9H as a 9, ...)
if there are cards on the table, it will play the selected card with the number that is already on the table (as the rules say).
